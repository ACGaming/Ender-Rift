# Ender-Rift
A Minecraft Forge Mod

## Description
What happens when you trap an in-flight ender pearl in a redstone field, and then send redstone flux to it? Someone found the answer during what seemed like a catastrophic failure of an experiment.

The ender pearl shatters and in its place a rift is opened into the between-space used by the endermen to teleport. Harnessing this rift, you are able to keep an unlimited amount of items in a seemingly tiny space.

**WARNING: Although the ender field is self-sustaining, if the ender field is destroyed, the rift closes, and it has been proven impossible to reach the same between-space ever again!**
